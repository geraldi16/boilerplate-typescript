# TypeScript Boilerplate

Welcome to my simple project. :)

This is a simple boilerplate for using typescript, so we don't need to set up everything from the beginning.
I hope this simple project can help you develop typescript fast!

## Setup
To test this typescript package, run these commands
```
npm install
npm run start
```
You will see `hello world` as result of this compile.

## Running Test
Run this command:
```
jest example.spec.ts
```
